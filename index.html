      <h2>Main Characters</h2>
      <h5>Tartuffe</h5>
      Tartuffe is a middle aged man who speaks in very profound poetic sentences. He is known 
      around the society for fooling people. On the outside he speaks like a holy 
      man while keeping big lies and having mal intentions. In the play Tartuffe has Madam Parnelle 
      and Orgon caught into his web of lies and tries to take all their fortune.
      <h5>Orgon</h5>
      Orgon is the father of Mariane and is brought into Tartuffe’s lies. Orgon is in a particularly high position in society with significant wealth. Throughout the play he insists that Tartuffe is a holy man 
      and even wishes he join his family by marrying his daughter. However when the play takes an unexpected turn we see how ego affects decision making skills.
      <h5>Madam Parnelle</h5>
      Madam Parnelle is the mother of Orgon. Similarly to her son she also believes that Tartuffe is the holiest man alive. She loves him 
      dearly and believes in all the lies that Tartuffe tells her. Everyone in the family except for Orgon tries to tell her the truth behind Tartuffe but she refuses 
      to believe them. In critical moments in the play we see how she reacts to her direct family vs the hippocratic lies of Tartuffe.
      <h5>Elmire</h5>
      Elmire is the mother of Mariane and the wife of Orgon. She sees Tartuffe as a liar and does not believe Tartuffe like her husband or her mother in law (Madam Parnelle). 
      She is a key character in relieving Tartuffe's true nature in that she tries to make relations with him and reveal his hypocrisy.
      <h5>Mariane</h5>
      Mariane is the daughter of Orgon. She also see’s Tartuffes lies and does not believe in him. 
      She is in love with another man Valere. She is instructed by her father to
      marry Tartuffe however she is conflicted on either following her fathers wishes or standing up for her own. We see through the play how she interacts with
      Valere and how her conflict continues with discussions with Dorine.
      <h5>Dorine</h5>
      Dorine is the maid of the house. She does not believe Tartuffe at all and even motivates Mariane to speak up for herself and 
      follow her own wishes and not her fathers. She tries to convince Orgon and Madam Parnelle of the truth of Tartuffe however is unsuccessful. 
      It is interesting to see her reactions when the play takes a turn and the truth of Tartuffe is revealed.

          <h2>Plot and Theme</h2>
          <p>The play begins with the introduction of Tartuffe, who is said to be a hippocratic liar who fools 
            everyone with his highly profound language. All the characters have suspicions about him other than Madam Parnelle and Orgon. 
            The play walks through several encounters with Tartuffe, however things take a turn in the play when the true nature of Tartuffe is revealed.</p>
          <p>Throughout the play we can see a recurring theme of Ego. Orgon and 
            Madame Pernelle are so caught up in Tartuffe’s lies that they are bought 
            into the lies of holiness that Tartuffe shows. Whether that be from the amount 
            of wealth and class standing that they have in society however Madame Pernelle 
            and Orgon are not willing to accept that they are wrong 
            about Tartuffe instead they put the blame on others.</p>
